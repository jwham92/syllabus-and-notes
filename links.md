# Culture

- [Computer Networks - The Heralds Of Resource Sharing](https://archive.org/details/ComputerNetworks_TheHeraldsOfResourceSharing): this doc is pretty old (1972), technical + dry... but oh boy is it a gem! It includes interviews with many of the folks who invented the Internet. While it's mostly focused on the US side of things (the ARPANET had only just been invented less than handful of years prior) it does also feature folks on the UK side (of the NPL network).

- [BBS: the Documentary](https://archive.org/details/BBS.The.Documentary/BBS.The.Documentary.ep1.avi): Internet archivist && documentary Jason Scott is responsible for documenting and preserving so much of the Internet's cultural history from documentaries on [early text adventure games](https://archive.org/details/getlamp-interviews) to various archives of online folk culture, including most notably the [GeoCities Archive](https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=GeoCities_Torrent_Patch). This documentary on early Bulletin Board Systems from 2005 might be a little rough around the edges, but boy is it a treasure. it's an incredibly in depth look at the Internet's social spaces long before social media (or the web in general) PACKED w/interviews. a true gem.

- [Cyberpunk](https://archive.org/details/cyberpunk_201410): this 1990 doc by Marianne Trench about the cyberpunk culture is hella 90s (the aesthetic is to die for). Goes into all things cyberpunk from Virtual Reality to "cyber arts" to mind machines. some great interviews in this one, including William Gibson (author && father of cyberpunk), to Timothy Leary (the notorious LSD evangolist) to Jaron Lanier (VR pioneer turned digital rights advocate). Quite a gem.

- [Hyperland](https://archive.org/details/DouglasAdams-Hyperland): this BBC doc form 1990 is written by && stars Douglas Adams (author of A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy), it's a history of "hypermedia" released just before the World Wide Web took off, ie. just before anyone had any real experience w/hypermedia (that serendipitous timing makes this a unique historical artifact). The the film itself is a single-channel linear video, it tries to present the viewer w/what a hypermedia experience is like through the film's aesthetic (which is also a very tasty 90's aesthetic). I'mma call it... it's a gem.

- [Aunauthorized Access](https://archive.org/details/UnauthorizedAccess): "using new technologies in a way which is not intended." -- unnamed German hacker. this is another gem! a doc made in 1994 by Annaliza Savage, she traveled to 15 cities in four countries to record the stories of notorious hackers (&& hacker culture) in that era. Not the DIY home-brew tinkier sort of hacker (like the kind discussed in Revolution OS) but the "black hoodie" breaking into systems sort of hacker. Though illegal, this was a time before the "[Cyberwar](https://www.viceland.com/en_us/show/cyberwar)" era we're in now, most of these hackers weren't paid, they weren't after money, they did what they did either for political/activist reasons, or for the challenge, or sometimes just for fun.

- **net.art**: unfortunately there doesn't really exist a single comprehensive documentary Internet Art (ie. art world, think museum, galleries, collections, etc) or the early net.art movement (though there are plenty of [books](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79264.Internet_Art), [articles](http://netart.rocks/files/webwork.pdf) && online [archives](https://anthology.rhizome.org/)) but if i have to recommend a single video, this public lecture at the TATE in London by New Media curator [Christiane Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBHcKspN1cU) is a pretty solid crash course. beyond that, i think this talk by canonical net artist [Olia Lialina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBrQCMz9uPA) is a great explortaion into net art aesthetics && it's inspirations (among other things), in this Creator's Project feature on net artist [RafaÃ«l Rozendaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2PlTV-RvnE) Rozendaal does a good job of expressing some popular net art sentiments/perspectives && these mini-docs on net art collectives [F.A.T. Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b0rlJvO1BQ) && [Deep Lab](https://vimeo.com/116314844) do a solid job of highlighting net art politics + philosophies.

- [Revolution OS](https://archive.org/details/RevolutionOS): though  admittedly  not as exciting as the previous docs (in terms of it's style) this 2001 doc does a pretty solid job of explaining the history + philosophies of the Open Source + Free Software movement[s]. It includes plenty of interviews w/influential figures of the movement[s] like Linus Torvalds && Richard Stallman.

- **Internet Folk Culture**: this is a catch all term i use for things like online fandoms, memes, forums, animated gifs, YouTubers (although at this point that's gone pretty mainstream/commercial), && while there's no single doc that covers all of these things, the PBS series [Off Book](https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSoffbook/videos) did a solid job of documenting bits && pieces. online culture moves really fast && this series is already 5 years old (&& u can tell), but it's still a pretty solid resource.

- **the Tech Industry**: when we think of the tech industry, we tend to think of Silicon Valley, but the reality is that the industry is today (&& in many ways has always been) a worldwide phenomenon. There a couple of great series (with multiple docs each) that explore tech startup culture around the world, the first is by Bloomberg called [Hello World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKvZPpdGjiM&list=PLqq4LnWs3olVtd-fSbmz8a0KhoBCB8JW4) the other i also highly recommend is by Wired && it's called [Future Cities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdraBbJv7p0&list=PLPoleY2BUvKcRKFRyHGhub3ugGlYebhCS)

- **the Tech Counter-Culture**: tech startups aren't the only places where new innovative technologies are born, far from it. these [Motherboard](https://www.youtube.com/user/MotherboardTV) docs are a great source of radical work being done outside commercial contexts, both in the past (like this one on [Telidon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjMUe7hkwRs) an early gov funded + artist embraced Internet service in Canada) && present (like this one on the [Equitable Internet Initiative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0u6nvcTsI) non-profit group building their own Internet in low-income neighborhoods of Detroit).


### tech moves fast...

...&& i'm often asked by students where they can go to "stay up to date", there's no 1 stop site for all of the things, but here are a few YouTube channels, podcats && writers/journalists i recommended to stay up to date w/the tech industry, DIY communities, the net art world && tech culture + politics in general:

- [BBC Click](https://www.youtube.com/user/ClickBBC)
- [N-O-D-E](https://n-o-d-e.news/) (also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvrLvII5oxSWEMEkszrxXEA))

# Code

- [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is probably the most comprehesive site for finding web coding tutorials + references (especially references). Almost anything u would eve rwant to know about [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) && [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (for the browser) can be found there.

## APIs

API stands for "Application Programming Interface", which is a general term for an "interface" for "programmers" to use when building "applications." B/c APIs are for programmers they interface is usually a code-interface interface rather than a graphical-interface like the kind we make for "end-users" (ie. non-programmers) also known as GUIs or "Graphical User Interface." APIs come in many different shapes + sizes (so to speak). Below are links to documentation for different APIs we might want to use in our projects.

- https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis

### Browser APIs

### Services APIs

- [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) a weather API
- [IP Geolocation API](http://ip-api.com/) an API for looking up geographic information, as well as other network/device information from an IP address
- [Programmable Web](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis) a HUGE searchable list of all sorts of APIs. I often feel like search engines are the best place to find APIs but this site has curated a pretty comprehensive collection (which is always nice).


## Libraries + Frameworks

A programming "Library" or "Framework" is a bunch of code someone else wrote to make ur life easier. These usually abstract common tasks into simple functions, for example say you wanted to make an interactive map of SAIC, that looked/worked the same way that Google Maps or Apple Maps does. u would need to write hundreds (maybe thousands) of lines of code just to get the basic functionality down of a map u could zoom or pan around in before u even start working on the actual content (the map drawings themselves). because interactive maps are a "common" functionality, there are libraries for that! My favorite is [Leafelet.js](https://leafletjs.com/), which give u all the standard map-type functionality && let's u focus on the specifics (inserting ur own map tiles, markers, etc.). Like the APIs above, a library will usually have documentation which shows u how to use it, usually telling u the names of all the pre-written functions u can use (we also call this the libraries's API, b/c it's our "interface" into the library which is itself a tool for programming applications).

- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/): a library for working with dates && times. JavaScript already comes w/a very robust `Date` object, but sometimes doing more complicated tasks re:to times/dates can get daunting, that's when this library can be useful.

- [p5*js](https://p5js.org/): a library for creating interactive + generative drawings. specifically designed to help artists && designers learn to code. p5 describes itself as a "Library", but it's a bit more like a "Framework" (see below).

Folks often ask what the difference between a "Library" && a "Framework" is. This can sometimes be an arbitrary distinction, but generally a Library is a set of tools (usually list of functions/methods) which u import into ur project && use however u want, where as a Framework (like the name implies) is something u wrap around ur project && provides a specific structure (in addition to pre-written functions/methods) for creating a specific sort of application. For example...

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): a framework for writing web servers.
- [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/): a framework for writing mobile apps (Android, iOS)
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/): a framework for writing desktop applications (same one used to create Atom, our code editor!)
