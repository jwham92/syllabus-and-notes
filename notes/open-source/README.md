## Free/Libre Open Source Software

> the whole GNU project is really one big hack, it's one big act of subversive clever playfulness, to change society for the better, because I'm only interested in changing it for the better, but in a clever way. ⸺Richard Stallman

## Free Software
#### an ideological position

> There is a similarity between the folk process—where a poem or a song or a story can get refined and reshaped by one teller or singer after another—and the way free software gets improved. You often find cases where a free program is being developed now by a group of people who include none of the original developers. ⸺Richard Stallman

as it is often xplained, the “free” in Free Software, isn’t about money (though technically yes, it usually happens to be “free” as in “free beer”1) rather it’s about “freedom”. in 1986 Richard Stallman defined a couple of key freedoms, “First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you. Second, the freedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it controlling you; for this, the source code must be made available to you.” Today Free Software is defined by the following “four freedoms”2:

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).

- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).

- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## Open Source
#### an apolitical position

the term “open source” software refers to a software development model which came from the Free Software movement but wanted to disassociate itself from the politix (the ideological impetus) of the Free Software movement && rather focus on the practical (even commercial) benefits of open source development.

let’s keep going w/the analogy from that video to explain how a typical proprietary (copyright) software license might work in recipe-form. w/proprietary software the source-code is hidden/secret (closed source) so u never get access to the recipe, instead u’ve got to buy pre-packaged microwavable meals. but u don’t technically “own” these microwavable meals, u simply “license” them, which means u’re allowed to use the meal as per a set of terms && agreements u must spend a few hours reading + agree to before every time u pop it into the microwave. these terms govern what u are + aren’t allowed to do, for example: u would typically be allowed to eat the meal when it comes out of the microwave, but u can’t share any part of ur meal w/ur friend (they have to purchase their own sh!tty microwavable meal). additionally there may be restrictions on the kind of microwave && plate u’re allowed to use to cook ur meal (these restrictions are legal, not technical of course, in theory any microwave or plate works, u’re just not allowed to use ‘em). this might get frustrating, especially considering how crapy the meal is; it’s so bad ur first thought after biting into it might be “this needs some salt or hot sauce or something”, but u can’t add any of that, b/c any/all modifications to the meal are prohibited.

at this point u might say to urself, “F* it, imma make my own version of this dish from scratch”... sure, in theory that’s ok, but u can’t do so by looking at the back of the box && reading the ingredients list (that’s kept secret, a bit scary when u think to ask, “how do we know it’s safe?”), u could try to “reverse engineer” it, by teasing apart the individual pieces of mush in the meal… but that’s difficult b/c the company producing them added some extra goup to the mush meal ([DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management)) to make it difficult to mess w/ + it’s also likely against that initial terms && agreement u signed to even try to “reverse engineer” it. at this point u might be pretty frustrated && so u think, “F* it, i’ve got like 10 boxes of this crap left, i’mma use it prop up my desk instead of eating it”... but that too might be against the terms && conditions, in the section covering what u’re allowed to do && not do w/ur licensed microwavable meal.

## economic + ideological side note

there’s a crucial difference between the software we produce from code && the meals we produce from food which raises the ante a bit, && the fact that software is an “information good” or a “non-rivalrous” good, where as food is “rivalrous”, to xplain i’ll quote at length the collaborative writing of one of our favorite “open-source” initiatives, wikipedia:

> Most economists agree that open-source candidates have an information good (also termed "knowledge good") aspect. In general, this suggests that the original work involves a great deal of time, money, and effort. However, the cost of reproducing the work is very low, so that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost – this is referred to as the marginal cost of a product. Copyright creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production. This allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work, without needing to find a single customer that can bear the entire cost. Conventional copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost. Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a derivative work—such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature, or a remix of a song—but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so. ⸺wikipedia entry for open-source

to recap: a typical economic good is “rivalrous,” that is to say that the use or consumption of the good prevents another consumer from simultaneous consumption. furthermore, in order to create another unit of a rival good for other consumers, social resources need to be invested. we call the cost of creating an additional unit its marginal cost. a chair is rival because if I am sitting on a chair no one else can sit on it, additionally if one was to build a second chair u would need wood, which could otherwise be used to create a table, crate, etc. software, howerver, is not rivalrous (once it’s been created, ie. post marginal cost) is infinitely reproducible, from one position this great! from another, it’s horrible! specifically if u’re motives are to make money && the only way u know how is through scarcity. Copyright then is a messy/bureaucratic (not to mention xpensive to enforce) way of artificially imposing scarcity on a non-rivalrous good; it comes w/a whole host of side-effects (only just slightly touched on towards the end of the quote) but we do this anyway b/c [1] we’re afraid if we don’t than no one will make anything (ie. no one will put in the initial development costs) [2] we don’t know any other way to make money… which is where open-source comes in: FSF politix aside, it takes the position that focing scarcity on software does more harm than good + there’s a much better way to do this

> (...) both in theory and as far as empirical evidence shows, there is remarkably little support in economics for regulating information, knowledge, and cultural production through the tools of intellectual property law. , ⸺Yochai Benkler (“The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom.” Yale University Press, 2006.)

in economics, culture and knowledge (beyond software, movies, music anything that can be digitally reproduced) are considered information. information is non-rival, it has a marginal cost of zero, && as Thomas Jefferson explained in a dispute over patents, it is the nature of ideas that, “no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.” anytime we set the price of information above zero, we are imposing limits, forcing on it an unnatural scarcity. this is done to provide incentive for its production. however, economically we understand that when we do this we create an inefficient market. open-source seeks to provide a model/framework for how we might benefit from the sharing/collaborative potential of software && other information goods w/out any of the side-effects that come w/copyright.
