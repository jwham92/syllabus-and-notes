This doc is a gem! made in 1994 by Annaliza Savage, she traveled to 15 cities in four countries to record the stories of notorious hackers (&& hacker culture) in that era. Not the DIY home-brew tinkier sort of hacker (like the kind discussed in Revolution OS) but the "black hoodie" breaking into systems sort of hacker. Though illegal, this was a time before the "[Cyberwar](https://www.viceland.com/en_us/show/cyberwar)" era we're in now, most of these hackers weren't paid, they weren't after money, they did what they did either for political/activist reasons, or for the challenge, or sometimes just for fun.

Next week we'll be using the Terminal, which is a "command line interface" (CLI), complete the [codecademy command line course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) to get acquainted with it by next week.
