# Supplies + Materials

Before anything else, sign up for the GitHub [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack), it comes w/discounts + credit for many of the services we'll be using in class. U can expect to spend up to $50 in hosting and domain name fees this semester, but that can drop to $0 w/the student developer pack.

# Hardware

Students are expected to bring their laptops to class every week. Because the classroom is fitted with a Mac computer, the lectures/workshops will be MacOS based. We will also be logging onto servers which will be Linux based, but fortunatly both Mac && Linux are Unix-inspred operating systems so they have more or less the same command line. If you are using Windows (instead of Linux or Mac) then we'll need to talk.

U will be expected to keep specific notes in class, while this could be done on ur computer i always recommend purchasing a grid-paper notebook as it also comes in handy for sketching out ideas before attempting something in code (the grid paper maps nicely to the x/y pixel-based layouts of our screens). That said, a physical notebook is optional.

U may (depending on the experiments I end up assigning in class, see syllabus for more details) be required to purchase a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3055) computer, as well as a [micro SD card](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294) (8-16GB) && [power adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995). If/when i assign an experiment that requires this i will make note of it in class.

# Software

All the software we'll be using in class is free + open source. that's great cause we don't have to pay for stuff, but the benefits of open source software has less to do w/finances than it does other stuff (we'll be talking about this later in the semester).

#### Code Editor

The first thing u'll need is a Code Editor. When u "code" it just means u're creating a text file like any other, except that the language u're writing in isn't English, Spanish or French, it's a computer programming language. This means any app that lets u type text into it can be used to write code. That said, just like there are editors that come w/extra features to make it easier to write in English (for example Microsoft Word which has spell-check + grammar-check) there are editors that come w/extra features to make it easier to write code. The one we'll be using in class is called [Atom](https://atom.io/). We'll be using Atom for a few reasons besides the fact that it's open source, but there are some other great Code Editors out there too, like [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) && [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (if u already prefer one of these that's ok, but keep in mind i will be using Atom exclusively during lectures).

#### HTTP Client (aka WWWeb Browser)

We'll also need an web client (aka a browser), because we'll be predominately writing code meant to be viewed "online" we need a browser to view our work in. Browsers also come w/built-in developer tools which help to debug && inspect the code we write, the browser we'll be using in class is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). U should actually download as many browsers as u can, we'll be using Firefox, but it's important to test ur work on other browsers b/c u never know what browser ur audience is going to be using, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) or Edge (or worse, Safari or Internet Explorer).

#### FTP Client

We'll also need an FTP client to upload + download files onto our servers, the one we'll be using in class is called [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). That said, it's worth noting that just like the other apps, FileZilla isn't the only FTP client in town, a few other popular ones include [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), [Transmit](https://www.panic.com/transmit/) && [Fetch](https://fetchsoftworks.com/)

#### Command Line Tools

We're also going to be using a couple of command line programs (we'll be learning how to use the command line, aka Terminal, early in the semester), the first one is called [git](https://git-scm.com/), which is version control software. Version control is something else we'll be talking about this semester, it helps us keep track of all the changes we make to a project in an organized + incredibly useful way. The second command line tool we'll be using is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), make sure u download the "LTS" release. Node is a JavaScript "runtime." JavaScript is the defacto programming language of the Internet which we'll be learning this semester, Node is what takes the JavaScript code we write && turns it into the 1's && 0's the computer understands.


# Online Services/Accounts

We'll need to sign up for a few online services in class, this is where that [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) i mention up top comes in handy. It might take a week or so for the pack registration to complete, but that's ok, right now u can sign up to all these accounts for free && we'll just hold off on buying stuff until ur student pack registration completes.

#### GitHub

First, we'll need to sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is essentially a social media site for git (the version control software mentioned above). It's one of the most important sites for any coder, it serves as ur code portfolio, it's a place to backup ur projects, it's where ur collaborate w/other coders, where u'll find other code libraries to use in ur own projects && so much more! we'll be using it A LOT in class (as you can see already). As soon as u make ur GitHub account send me an email w/a link to ur GitHub profile! It's worth mentioning that GitHub is the most popular site of it's kind, but there are others like [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), && some folks role out their own w/[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

#### Namecheap

Next u'll need to sign up for [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), which provides a handful of basic web services, we'll be using it mostly to buy domain names. There are other web hosting sites which provide similar services (including domain name registration) like [godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), [1and1](https://www.1and1.com/), [bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) && [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/), but in my opinion Namecheap beats them all (&& i've used them all :-).

#### Digital Ocean

Next u'll need to sign up for [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), which is a piece of "the cloud." You might have heard the expression, "the Cloud is really just other people's computers", && that's exactly right, we'll be renting computers from Digital Ocean to host (some of) our projects online. As w/everything else on the list there's other folks u can rent ur piece of the cloud from as well, like Amazon's [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) && Microsoft's [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).


#### StackOverflow

Last but not least u'll need to sign up for [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), which is arguably the largest online forum of coders helping other coders code. If u're ever stuck trying to code something, someone has either already asked + answered whatever question u have on StackOverflow && in the rare occasion that they haven't, u can ask a question urself && in minutes u'll have an answer (it's that good!). But u need to be careful, StackOverflow, like any community has it's own social norms, if u break these norms people get mad && won't help, but if u follow them other folks will literally compete to write ur code for u! We'll be discussing how to properly engage w/this community in class.
